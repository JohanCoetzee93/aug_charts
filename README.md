# aug_charts
Repo to be able to determine the relation between blocks in an aug chart.

Will be able to send the images of a company aug chart to an OCR to get the blocks of text.

A model will be able to get the relationships from the aug chart as coordinate matching pairs. 

Together with the matching pair coordinates and the blocks of text this will be able to generate the relationships of the aug chart in a readable "usable" way.
